# Visual Word Recognition: An invesitgation into top-down influences

There are inherent challenges when attempting to isolate the effects of feedback in cortical circuitry because of the observed response being an ambiguous amalgamation of top-down and bottom-up information. What may seem like a top-down effect is often heavily influenced by feedforward circuitry. For example, scene categorization may seem like a top-down task, but is actually heavily influenced by low-level processing. Visual word recognition is a unique domain that allows to measure changes in low-level behavior that result from direct manipulations of top-down information. Unlike scene categorization, the semantic aspects of words are accessible only at the level of the whole word, individual letters, and the low-level visual statistics that comprise them, are present in many words and therefore not diagnostic of meaning. Thus, any variations in the word superiority effect (better recognition of letters within words than match consonant strings) that result from semantic manipulations must be the result of feedback passing between the word and letter representations. Here, we begin a series of studies using a variant of a word superiority paradigm to examine the behavioral effects of high-level semantics on letter recognition.
